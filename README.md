# Lapse + Mast1c0re = Laps3c0re!
A port of [Lapse](https://github.com/kmeps4/PSFree/blob/main/lapse.mjs), which is a kernel exploit implementation by **@abc**, using [Mast1c0re](https://github.com/McCaulay/mast1c0re) by [@McCaulay](https://github.com/McCaulay) as an entry point.

## Setup Guide

### Pre-requisites:

- A PS4/PS5 on a supported FW version.
- A digital, activated copy of the game Okage: Shadow King, acquired from PSN.
- PS2 Network or USB ELF Loader. Pre-release builds made by [@EchoStretch](https://github.com/EchoStretch) can be found here: [mast1c0re-ps2-usb-elf-loader-505-1252.7z](https://www.mediafire.com/file/p9aii0yv68glkvd/mast1c0re-ps2-usb-elf-loader-505-1252.7z/file), [mast1c0re-ps2-network-elf-loader-505-1252.7z](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vfr9p1r83cx1fab/mast1c0re-ps2-network-elf-loader-505-1252.7z/file).
- Laps3c0re binaries, can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/iMrDJAi/laps3c0re/releases) section.

### Steps

- Follow this guide to have a modded Okage savegame with an ELF loader on your console: [Creating the save and adding the exploit data to it](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS4:Jailbreak_With_Mast1c0re%2BLapse#Creating_the_save_and_adding_the_exploit_data_to_it).
- On a USB stick formatted as exFAT with MBR (GPT partitioning won't work), download the latest [GoldHEN](https://ko-fi.com/sistro/shop) and put `goldhen.bin` in the root of your USB. (TODO: A variation that loads `payload.bin`, or both, will be available soon). Then insert it into your console.
- For network loader:
  - Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and the script dependencies: `pip install progress`.
  - Open Okage, press the `start` button (which is in reality just the right side of the touch pad), then select "RESTORE GAME".
  - Run the following command on your terminal to send the laps3c0re payload to your console: `python ./mast1c0re-send-file.py -i 192.168.x.xx -p 9045 -f ./laps3c0re-PSx-xx-xx.elf`. (Replace `192.168.x.xx` by your console IP and `laps3c0re-PSx-xx-xx.elf` by the binary corresponding to your console's FW version).
- For USB loader:
  - Copy `laps3c0re-PSx-xx-xx.elf` that corresponds to your console's FW to the `ELFs/` directory in your USB stick. Then insert it into your console. See this [example](https://github.com/McCaulay/mast1c0re-ps2-usb-elf-loader?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-a-usb).
  - Open Okage, press the `start` button (which is in reality just the right side of the touch pad), then select "RESTORE GAME". Finally, follow the prompt to load Laps3c0re.

- To receive logs, run the command `ncat --udp --listen --keep-open --recv-only -p 9023` from a computer running at the IP address `192.168.1.39`. You'll need to have [NetCat](https://nmap.org/download) installed.

**Note:** Soon, Laps3c0re will be available in a stand-alone savegame format, eliminating the need for an ELF loader.
